# ThinkLikeAI
An interactive web app that introduces **middle school students** to the **probabilistic nature** of large language models (LLMs) through hands-on experimentation. Students manipulate key sampling parameters (**temperature** and **top-p**) and see the visual distribution of the next word's probabilities.
